# About the game
You play as a virus trying to cololize a human body. You colonize rooms by eliminating all enemies. Each room has a Nexus, which is like a boss for each room. When the Nexus is defeated the room is colonized. When you have colonized all rooms in a level you can proceed to the next level. 

Unreal Engine 4 was used for the whole project.
